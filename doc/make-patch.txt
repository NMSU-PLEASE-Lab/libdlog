Using diff is simple whether you are working with single files or entire source directories. To create a patch for a single file, use the form:

diff -u original.c new.c > original.patch

To create a patch for an entire source tree, make a copy of the tree:

cp -R original new

Make any changes required in the directory new/. Then create a patch with the following command:

diff -rupN original/ new/ > original.patch
